After cleaning the dataset obtained from the automation, the following was done:
- dropped null values
- displayed the discount percentage distribution which showed a non-standard distribution
- then categorized and counted the disount groups which showed an imbalanced dataset thus undersampling was doen to solve this issue
- Used labelEncoder before training an LR model since we need all columns to be numeric. 
(We have binary options in the shipping column so labelEncoderwas used)
- after training the following can be seen:
Metric     Value
----------------------
MAE        11.57668953133974
MSE        222.24431509659286
RMSE       14.907860849115572
R²         0.5807530206277446

This shows that the error of the predictions is between 11-15% 
R² score shows that the model performance isn't great (approx. 58%)
This can be seen in the graphs were approx half of the predictions were correct
- Finally the model was tested on incomplete data
